`NifH_Clusters.py` is a script to determine where putative nitrogen fixing sequences sit on a NifH tree. This script came from [the Zehr Lab](https://www.jzehrlab.com/nifh). 
The script is descripted in [Frank et al. 2016](https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1758-2229.12455)
